## NamUs Project
Description: The purpose of this project was to build a GAN that can take forensic sketches of unidentified persons and attempt to produce more realistic photos of them using a GAN/VAE. From there, the photographs and details of the found person will be matched with the data of known missing persons to see if there is a match.

Unfortunately NamUs does not provide an API and I don't want to break Terms and Conditions by trying to scrape so I'll be abandoning this project for now. It remains a useful basic reference for how to scrape JSON.
